## Trachoma Detection Models

### Overview

This repository houses machine learning models designed for the detection of trachoma, a serious eye infection that can lead to blindness if left untreated. Trachoma is a major public health concern in many regions, and early detection plays a pivotal role in its management.

> ### Models
>
> **VGG16 Model**: Based on the VGG16 architecture, this model has been fine-tuned specifically for trachoma detection. It boasts high accuracy in identifying trachoma cases from images.

**Custom Model**: We've developed a custom neural network model tailored to excel in trachoma detection. It offers an optimal balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.

These models can be a valuable tool for medical professionals and researchers working to combat trachoma.
