# clear Sight
Clear Sight is a mobile application that is used to detect Trachoma by using a machine learning model.

# Aim of the Project
The aim of developing a trachoma detector application is to leverage technology to assist in the early detection and diagnosis of trachoma, a contagious eye disease caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. Trachoma is a leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide, particularly in developing regions with limited access to healthcare resources.
The trachoma detector application utilizes computer vision and machine learning algorithms to analyze images of the eye and detect signs of trachoma infection. By capturing images of the eye using a smartphone or other imaging device, the application can identify specific indicators of trachoma, such as trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF) or trachomatous inflammation-intense (TI), which are used in the clinical diagnosis of the disease.
Overall, the aim of developing a trachoma detector application is to leverage technology to improve the accessibility, efficiency, and accuracy of trachoma screening and diagnosis. By doing so, it can contribute to the global efforts to eliminate trachoma as a public health problem and reduce the burden of preventable blindness.

# How Does It Work
This model is trained with more than 1,500 pictures and most of the data are collected using web scrapping which involves using automated software or scripts to retrieve specific information from web pages, such as text, images, tables, or other structured data.
The application is developed using Flutter an open-source UI (User Interface) toolkit developed by Google. It allows developers to build natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop platforms from a single codebase. Flutter uses the Dart programming language
The model is developed using the following
Image Processing Library: PIL (Python Imaging Library) and OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) are commonly used libraries for image processing tasks. PIL provides functionalities for image loading, manipulation, and basic processing operations. OpenCV is a powerful library that offers a wide range of image processing algorithms, such as image filtering, edge detection, and feature extraction.
Pandas: Pandas is a popular data manipulation library in Python. It provides data structures and functions for efficiently handling and manipulating structured data, particularly tabular data. Pandas allows you to load and preprocess data, perform data cleaning, filtering, aggregation, and other data wrangling tasks, making it useful for preparing image datasets or working with other relevant data.
Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a versatile plotting library in Python. It provides a wide range of functions for creating various types of visualizations, including line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, and more. Matplotlib is often used for visualizing data distributions, displaying training and evaluation metrics, and presenting the results of the model.
TensorFlow: TensorFlow is a popular open-source machine learning framework developed by Google. It provides a comprehensive ecosystem for building and deploying machine learning models, including neural networks. TensorFlow offers a high-level API called Keras, which simplifies the process of building and training deep learning models.
Keras: Keras is an open-source deep learning library that runs on top of TensorFlow (and other backends). It provides a user-friendly interface for defining and training neural networks. Keras allows you to easily design various types of neural network architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and more.
Scikit-learn (sklearn): Scikit-learn is a widely used machine learning library in Python. It offers a broad range of machine learning algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. Sklearn provides convenient functions for data preprocessing, model evaluation, and model selection, which can be beneficial in the development pipeline.
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model: Convolutional Neural Networks are a type of deep learning model commonly used for image classification and computer vision tasks. CNNs are designed to automatically learn hierarchical representations from input images using multiple layers of convolutional and pooling operations. These networks can capture spatial patterns and features in images, making them well-suited for tasks like object recognition.



# Features of the Application
## Make a conversation with the user 
## Take an eye Image of the given person and process it. 
## By analyzing the person's location, gender, and family case status it will try to predict more accurately 

# How to use the application 
We try to make it as simple as possible because we aimed particularly in developing regions with limited access of Information and Techonlogy.
