# Clear Sight
Clear Sight is a mobile application that is used to detect Trachoma by using a machine learning model.

# Aim of the Project
The aim of developing a trachoma detector application is to leverage technology to assist in the early detection and diagnosis of trachoma, a contagious eye disease caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. Trachoma is a leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide, particularly in developing regions with limited access to healthcare resources.
The trachoma detector application utilizes computer vision and machine learning algorithms to analyze images of the eye and detect signs of trachoma infection. By capturing images of the eye using a smartphone or other imaging device, the application can identify specific indicators of trachoma, such as trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF) or trachomatous inflammation-intense (TI), which are used in the clinical diagnosis of the disease.
Overall, the aim of developing a trachoma detector application is to leverage technology to improve the accessibility, efficiency, and accuracy of trachoma screening and diagnosis. By doing so, it can contribute to the global efforts to eliminate trachoma as a public health problem and reduce the burden of preventable blindness.

# How Does It Work
This model is trained with more than 1,500 pictures and most of the data are collected using web scrapping which involves using automated software or scripts to retrieve specific information from web pages, such as text, images, tables, or other structured data.
The application is developed using Flutter 
The model is developed using the following The model is developed using image processing library (PIL, openCV), pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib for visualization, machine learning frameworks (tensorflow, keras, sklearn), convolutional neural network model 


# Features of the Application
### Make a conversation with the user so that the model can have a better understanding of the user's status and provide user-specific suggestions  
### Take an eye Image of the given person to provide a learned guess of the trachoma case by processing it on the pre-trained model. 
###  In addition it will also analyze the person's location, gender, and family case status to predict more accurately 

# How to use the application 
We try to make it as simple as possible because we aim particularly at developing regions with limited access to Information and technology.
## 1. First, the user should know his age, past eye issues, location, and gender which could be the factor of the disease.
